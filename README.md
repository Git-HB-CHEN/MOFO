## âœ¨Paper

This repository provides the official implementation of Multi-Organ FOundation (MOFO) Model.

**Multi-Organ Foundation Model for Universal Ultrasound Image Segmentation with Task Prompt and Anatomical Prior**

#### Key Features

- Our **MOFO** is a segmentation foundation model formalized for multi-organ US universal segmentation, composed of the vision, prompt and prior branches, where the vision branch directly extracts organ-invariant representations from US images.
- The task prompt is generated by text embedding of the multi-organ task description in the prompt branch, and aggregated with image features to refine organ-specific representations of anatomical structures.
- A multi-organ auto-encoder is developed to construct a multi-organ anatomical prior space. Then its encoder serves as the anatomical prior encoder in the prior branch to map the anatomical structures of various organs into the prior space and apply constraints for the **MOFO**.
- A hybrid US image database consisting of diverse images of 10 organs from patients across multiple medical centers is assembled to demonstrate the effectiveness of the **MOFO**.

## âœ¨Architecture of MOFO
The MOFO comprises prompt, vision, and prior branches. The vision branch extracts organ-invariant representations from images for segmentation. The prompt branch aggregates task prompt and image features to generate organ-specific representations, guiding the vision branch in segmenting objects. The prior branch utilizes the anatomical prior encoder to map the prediction maps and ground truth into the prior space, applying constraints to ensure consistency.
